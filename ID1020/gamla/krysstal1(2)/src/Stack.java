* This program implements the Stack ADT from ch1.3
* It also contains two recursive and  two iterative functions.
* Two print functions, one iterative and one recursive.
* Two functions that add characters to a stack. One iterative and one recursive.
*
* The main function creates the stack and calls 'iterate' one time which will run a loop
* and push characters to the stack as long as the input character isn't '\n'(new line).
* When '\n' is entered the print function will print the symbol and pop from the stack until empty.
* The same happens with the recursive functions but those will keep calling themselves.
