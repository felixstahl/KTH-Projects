 *              README
 *       Author: Felix St√•hl
 *       Lab3 - Question 2
 *       Based on "Algorithms, 4th Edition" by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne
 *
 *    Test result for 50 000 words:
 *             Binary Search Tree in nanoseconds = 19280800, 22125600, 22074200, 19826100, 19233900
 * (binary search) Symbol Table  in nano seconds = 21302500, 25559100, 20765700, 23051800, 17570600
 * Average for Binary Search Tree: 20 508 120 = 0.02050812 sec
 *       Average for Symbol Table: 21 649 940 = 0.02164994 sec
 *
 * The above times are just the ones i wrote down for 5 consecutive runs. I have probably run this 50 times during
 * implementation and it seems like these times can differ a lot from time to time. It does not seem to follow any
 * pattern except that the average time in nanoseconds is a LITTLE less for Binary Search Tree...
 *
 *    Test result for 200 words:
 *             Binary Search Tree in nanoseconds = 12532200, 13399300, 12930400, 12725900, 12712500
 * (binary search) Symbol Table  in nano seconds = 12634500, 13758900, 12766000, 13714500, 13112600
 * Average for Binary Search Tree: 12 860 060 = 0.01286006 sec
 *       Average for Symbol Table: 13 197 300 = 0.0131973 sec
 *
 * Furthermore,
 * Time complexity of BST Best case is O(log N) for search, insert and delete since it keeps dividing the number of items
 * it needs to search, in order to find its way, by 2 every time.
 * Worst case is O(n).
 * The binary search Symbol Table is similar, it has O(n) search but instant insertion and deletion (both best and
 * worst case) since it implements the queue data structure.
 *
 * My conclusion,
 * it depends from time to time which ever is fastest for building and finding the largest key/value.
 * It is, however, better to use the ST if you know that it will be a lot of insertion and deletion,
 * and better to use BST if you know you are just gonna do a lot of searching.
