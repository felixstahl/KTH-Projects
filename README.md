# KTH-projects
This repository is supposed to be divided by each course from KTH in each folder, but somewhere along the way it didn't stay that way. It's a total mess, deal with it.

In all seriousness, I had no idea what I was doing in the beginning, I'm slowly making this repo more structured(or not, I'll probably leave it as a memory from when I first learned how to code). I made readme files in each folder that says which course it is. This will make it easier to see exactly which folder belongs where and to what course.
