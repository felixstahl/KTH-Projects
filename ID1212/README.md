For the course ID1212 (networkprogramming) there are 4 tasks and a project to complete.

Task 1 was to create Hangman - the game.

Task 2 was to create Hangman but with non blocking tcp sockets.

Task 3 was to create (with RMI) a server with database access and a client which should be able to register, login, logout, upload and download files (in this case we only used .txt but i guess .pdf or .java would work aswell). Also, if a file was downloaded, the owner (the one uploader) should be notified if he is still online.
