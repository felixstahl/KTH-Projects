For the course ID1212 (networkprogramming) there are 4 tasks and a project to complete.

Task 1 was to create Hangman - the game.

Task 2 was to create Hangman but with non blocking tcp sockets.

Task 3 was to create (with RMI) a server with database access, and a client, which should be able to register, login, logout, upload and download files (in this case we only used .txt but i guess .pdf or .java would work aswell). Also, if a file was downloaded, the owner (the uploader of the file) should be notified if he is still online.

Task 4 was to create a webapplication for converting money between different currencies, using Spring and Thymeleaf. The db had pre-set values for every currency back and fourth, e.g. SEK to USD and USD to SEK.

Project is soon to come...
