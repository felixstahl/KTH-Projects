# KTH-projects
This repository is supposed to be devided by each course from KTH in each folder, but somewhere along the way it didn't stay that way. It's a total mess, deal with it.

In all seriousness I had no idea what I was doing in the beginning, I'm slowly making this repo more structured(or not, I'll leave it as a memory from when I first learned how to code).
